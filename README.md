# UserManager

Assignment for UI Developer

Please spend approximately 3-4 hours on this task.

Create a responsive single-page application to display and manage a list of users. The application should be able to list, add, update and delete users in a well presented and user-friendly way.

Unit tests should also be provided for your code where appropriate.

Use the public API at https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users to make the relevant data requests.
(Your solution should contain a database, prepopulated with the data of https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users)

Note: The purpose of this exercise is so that we can measure your own skills and experience. Please avoid using third-party component ‘helper’ libraries (e.g. Angular Material or Bootstrap) other than those which provide the basic UI framework. If you are selected for interview, you will be asked to show your application working, and may be asked to step through it using a debugger.
